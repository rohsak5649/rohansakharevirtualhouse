                    <p>Hello, I am Rohan Sakhare, a computer engineering student at Dr. D. Y. Patil Institute of Technology in Pimpri, Pune. Originally hailing from Pandharpur, I came to Pune to pursue my passion for computer science engineering and was fortunate to secure admission through the TFWS (Tuition Fee Waiver Scheme) due to my outstanding performance in the entrance examination.

                        My academic journey has been complemented by a keen interest in iOS development. I have completed an iOS development course through an online platform, specifically the 'Hacking with Swift' website by the esteemed Paul Sir. This has allowed me to dive into the world of iOS application development, expanding my skill set and knowledge in this exciting field.
                        
                        Beyond academics and coding, I am a multifaceted individual with a diverse set of hobbies. I find solace in cycling through the streets of Pune, and I love exploring nature through trekking and capturing its beauty with my camera. Nature videography and photography are not just pastimes for me but also a creative outlet for self-expression.
                        
                        I believe in balancing the technical aspects of life with the beauty of the natural world, and this duality defines my interests and passions. My academic achievements, combined with my dedication to iOS development and my love for the great outdoors, shape my unique journey and aspirations.
                        
                        I am excited to continue growing in the world of iOS development and to explore the intersection of technology and nature in the future.</p>
